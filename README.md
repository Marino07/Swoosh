This is a brief preview of the application. Throughout the development process, I learned how to implement **Broadcasting** for real-time notifications, enhancing user interaction and engagement. Additionally, I gained valuable experience in using various technologies such as Laravel, Livewire,AlpineJS Tailwind CSS, which significantly improved my skills in building dynamic web applications. This project has been a great opportunity to apply my knowledge and explore new concepts in web development.
